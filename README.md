#Forked off of iden3/circomlibjs
This fork has been changed to support Starkware version of Poseidon3 contract for ethereum L1. Current version has been deployed on goerli at [0x84d43a8cbEbF4F43863f399c34c06fC109c957a4](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x84d43a8cbebf4f43863f399c34c06fc109c957a4). Byte code and abi included in the deployed folder. The updated implementation is reflected in Javascript(src/poseidon_reference.js) and EVM/Solidity OpCodes (src/poseidon_gencontract.js) Please note since only EVM Op codes are generated by the library, verifying the above deployment is not possible but of course feel free to generate your own contract. Follow test/poseidoncontract.js for an example.
